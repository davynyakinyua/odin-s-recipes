        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 teaspoons kosher salt </li>
            <li>4 teaspoons white sugar </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder </li>
            <li>2 racks baby back pork ribs </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>For the Glaze</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>⅓ cup ketchup </li>
            <li>¼ cup brown sugar </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil </li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix salt, sugar, black pepper, paprika, and garlic powder for dry rub together in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Line a large sheet pan with heavy-duty aluminum foil. Place rack of ribs on the prepared pan, bone side down. Poke all over with a sharp knife. Make shallow slits across at an angle, and then repeat the opposite way; this allows the dry rub to penetrate. Coat on both sides with rub; flip back over, ensuring the bone side is down. Wrap tightly with foil.</li>
            <li>Transfer to the center of the preheated oven and bake for 2 hours. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until cold and firm, at least 2 hours, up to overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat a charcoal grill until coals are very ashy and hot.</li>
            <li>Remove from the refrigerator, unwrap, and brush off excess fat. Slice between the bones to separate each rib.</li>
            <li>Combine ketchup, brown sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, oil, and cayenne with a spoon in a bowl for glaze.</li>
            <li>Place ribs on the preheated grill and cook for 2 minutes; flip and brush over glaze. Flip and repeat process until ribs are as caramelized as you prefer, about 10 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Remove to a plate and brush over one more application of glaze. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
